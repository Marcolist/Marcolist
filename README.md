👋 Hi, I’m Marco

I’m a community developer with a strong interest in blockchain infrastructure, wallet UX, and developer tooling.
I enjoy building practical, low-risk integrations that bridge new chains and ecosystems into existing developer platforms.

---

### 🧠 What I’m currently working on
- MetaMask Snaps, with a focus on **mobile-friendly and low-risk UX**
- An **SVM-based indexer** with database & API for on-chain data access
- A lightweight **DEX UI** for exploring liquidity pools and swaps
- Programmatic **Solana transaction tooling** (research & experimentation)

---

### 🔍 Areas of interest
- Wallet integrations & extensions
- Solana / SVM-compatible chains
- Developer experience (DX)
- Read-only & low-risk Web3 UX
- Indexing, RPCs, and on-chain data access

---

### 🛠 Tech I work with
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- Node.js
- Rust (learning)
- Solana / SVM tooling
- Docker, APIs, Indexers

---

### 🔐 Security & mindset
I build as a **community developer** and take a security-first approach.
If a project shows traction, my goal is always to coordinate with the respective ecosystem teams around proper reviews or audits before wider use.

---

### 🤝 Open to
- Technical feedback
- Architecture discussions
- Collaboration on developer tooling
- Conversations around wallet UX and cross-chain support
